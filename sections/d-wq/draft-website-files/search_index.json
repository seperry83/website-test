Aquatic plants require suitable light, nutrients, and water temperatures to survive. Aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to breathe, and rely on adequate water temperature, salinity, and pH to survive. Humans need fresh water for recreation, irrigation, as well as to drink. Because of these competing needs, water quality is not easily defined as “good” or “bad,” since it depends on who is using it. However, water quality monitoring is a way for scientists to understand the health of our aquatic ecosystem and to help balance the needs of all who use it. Typically, water quality is defined by regulated standards set by a regulatory agency, like the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). If water quality does not meet the regulated standards, then it can be defined as poor. Water quality can be monitored continuously or in a discrete manner, both of which are done by the Environmental Monitoring Program. Discrete water quality monitoring is conducted less frequently than continuous and provides a snapshot into the water conditions at a single moment in time, which is helpful for documenting long-term trends. This type of sampling involves collecting a large quantity of water samples on a monthly basis to be analyzed for numerous water quality tests by a chemical laboratory. The Environmental Monitoring Program monitors 24 fixed discrete water quality stations within the San Francisco Estuary. These stations are sampled monthly at high water slack tide and are primarily accessed by the Research Vessel Sentinel, or by vehicle transport for shore-based stations. Sampling at each of these stations consists of collecting a variety of physical parameters (e.g. water temperature and pH) and grab samples for laboratory analysis (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous). Analytes EMP collects data for six different field parameters and 18 different laboratory constituents. The analytes highlighted in this report are: Specific Conductance Turbidity Dissolved Ammonia Chlorophyll a Dissolved Nitrate+Nitrite Total Phosphorus Sites To analyze discrete water quality trends, the 24 fixed EMP stations are grouped into six regions of the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary: San Pablo Bay, Suisun and Grizzly Bay, Confluence, Central Delta, Southern Interior Delta, and Northern Interior Delta. Their locations are displayed below. Figure 1: Map of EMP’s discrete WQ field sites. "],["00-dwq-report.html", "Current Report Archived Reports", " Current Report Introduction Water year 2022 was classified as critical in the Sacramento Valley due to ongoing drought; the previous year was classified as critical (source). Regional facet graphs for 2022 were created for each parameter. The minimum and maximum values were determined for each field parameter or laboratory analyte to show that year’s range; instances when a result fell below the reporting limit were excluded from these minimum and maximum calculations. When this occurred, for the corresponding graph, a vertical dashed line capped at the reporting limit was used to represent the presence of a non-detect. Specific Conductance Surface specific conductance varied greatly in 2022 across the sampling regions with the highest levels occurring in the western regions (San Pablo Bay, Suisun &amp; Grizzly Bays, Confluence) due to the strong marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. Surface specific conductance ranged from 119 μS/cm (C3A in Northern Interior Delta, August) to 44933 μS/cm (D41 in San Pablo Bay, October) in 2022. Median specific conductance values in 2022 (medSpCnd = 4227 μS/cm) were lower than the 2021 median (medSpCnd = 5101 μS/cm). Figure 1: Specific Conductance at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. Turbidity Surface turbidity values ranged from 0.9 FNU (MD10A in Southern Interior Delta, November) to 109.3 FNU (NZS42 in Suisun &amp; Grizzly Bays, April) in 2022. Median turbidity values in 2022 (medTurb = 9.1 FNU) were higher than the 2021 median (medTurb = 8.3 FNU). Figure 2: Turbidity at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. Dissolved Ammonia Dissolved ammonia levels in 2022 ranged from &lt; 0.05 mg/L (the reporting limit) to 0.29 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, January) in 2022. Ammonia levels are typically lower throughout the Delta and Bays, likely due to dilution and nitrification. Median dissolved ammonia values in 2022 (medNH3 = 0.05 mg/L) were lower than the 2021 median (medNH3 = 0.057 mg/L). Figure 3: Dissolved Ammonia at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. Chlorophyll a Chlorophyll a values in 2022 ranged from &lt; 0.5 μ/L (the reporting limit) to 65.2 μ/L (D41A in San Pablo Bay, August) in 2022. The highest levels of chlorophyll a were seen in the San Pablo Bay region during August. Median chlorophyll a values in 2022 (medChla = 2.08 μ/L) were lower than the 2021 median (medChla = 2.37 μ/L). This was due to a harmful algal bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo. More information about the phytoplankton genera is described in the phytoplankton section. Figure 4: Chlorophyll a at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite Dissolved nitrate + nitrite levels in 2022 ranged from &lt; 0.05 mg/L (the reporting limit) to 5.47 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, February) in 2022. Median dissolved nitrate/nitrite values in 2022 (medDNN = 0.266 mg/L) were lower than the 2021 median (medDNN = 0.33 mg/L). The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest fluctuation of dissolved nitrate + nitrite concentrations and had the highest levels compared to the rest of the estuary, likely due to influence from nearby agricultural land use and wastewater treatment effluent. Figure 5: Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. Total Phosphorus Total phosphorus levels in 2022 ranged from 0.021 mg/L (C3A in Northern Interior Delta, March) to 0.462 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, June) in 2022. Median specific conductance values in 2022 (medTotPhos = 0.091 mg/L) were lower than the 2021 median (medTotPhos = 0.097 mg/L).The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest fluctuation of total phosphorus concentrations and had the highest levels compared to the rest of the estuary, likely due to influence from nearby agricultural land use and wastewater treatment effluent.
