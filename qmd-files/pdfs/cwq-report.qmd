## Introduction

The Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) are required by Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) to collect continuous water chemistry data to monitor the water quality at select sites in the upper San Francisco Estuary (Estuary). This report describes the results of these monitoring efforts for water year `r report_year` (October 1st `r prev_year` through September 30th `r report_year`) `r str_water_year(report_year, 'cur')` [(source)](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=WSIHIST). Results are compared to the previous water year, `r str_water_year(prev_year, 'prev')`.

## Methods

Discrete water quality samples were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the Upper Estuary and were grouped into regions based on their geographic location . These sites represent a variety of aquatic habitats, from narrow, freshwater channels to broad, estuarine bays.

Water quality data was continuously monitored at 15 sites throughout the Upper Estuary and were grouped into regions based on their geographic location (@fig-stations; @tbl-stations). These sites represent a variety of aquatic habitats, from narrow, freshwater channels to broad, estuarine bays. **Note**: CEMP's Sherman Island station (SSI), which was called D11A in previous reports, has been renamed D22A to better reflect it's location in relation to historical station D22.

Data were collected for six water quality parameters. All water samples were collected 1-meter below the water surface using a float-mounted YSI EXO2 multi-parameter water quality sonde. These parameters are:

-   Water Temperature (°C)
-   Specific Conductance (μS/cm)
-   Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)
-   pH
-   Turbidity (FNU)
-   Fluorescence (μg/L)

Regional facet graphs were created for each parameter.  The average, minimum, and maximum values were determined for parameter, both overall and per region. Average summary statistics are reported as the mean (μ) ± the standard deviation.

For more in-depth methodology, see [here](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=edi.1320.6).

## Results

### Water Temperature

`r strings_cwq_cur$disp_paragraph('WaterTemperature','mean', strings_cwq_prev)`

### Specific Conductance

`r strings_cwq_cur$disp_paragraph('SpC','mean', strings_cwq_prev)`

### Dissolved Oxygen

`r strings_cwq_cur$disp_paragraph('DissolvedOxygen','mean', strings_cwq_prev)`

#### Stockton Station DO Values

C-EMP monitors DO at the Stockton Ship channel to determine if/when it fall below limits established by the CVRWQCB (1998). For the months that coincide with the passage of fall-run Chinook salmon (October, November, and September), values `r obj_rri$disp_RRI_months('on months')`. For all other months, values `r obj_rri$disp_RRI_months('off months')`. A boxplot of the DO values is shown in @fig-rri. 

### pH

`r strings_cwq_cur$disp_paragraph('pH','mean', strings_cwq_prev)`

### Turbidity

`r strings_cwq_cur$disp_paragraph('Turbidity','mean', strings_cwq_prev)`

### Chlorophyll *a* Fluorescence

`r strings_cwq_cur$disp_paragraph('Fluorescence','mean', strings_cwq_prev)`

## Interpretations

Water Year 2023 began as a continuation of the preceding three years of drought conditions, but a deluge of atmospheric rivers beginning in late December and continuing through March brought high amounts of precipitation and a massive snowpack, which resulted in WY 2023 ultimately being classified as Wet.  

The extreme precipitation events and snowpack runoff led to a considerable drop in specific conductivity in the Delta. The low values persisted through WY 2023 in the Interior Delta regions, with the western regions of Grizzly/Suisun and the Confluence beginning to show a marine influence in July. Cooler than average air temperatures at the start of the water year and runoff from the record snowpack resulted in much cooler water average temperatures. The Water Year 2023 average was 2.1 ºC cooler than the critically dry Water Year 2022. High flows created by the winter storms resulted in high turbidity in January with maximum values in all regions exceeding 100 FNU. A smaller spike in turbidity occurred in March also due to storm runoff.
