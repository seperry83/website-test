## Introduction

Benthic monitoring conducted by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) since 1975 has documented changes in the composition, density, and distribution of the macrobenthic biota inhabiting the upper San Francisco Estuary. This monitoring is performed by the Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) as part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) and is one component of the biological monitoring mandated by Water Right Decision D-1641. Since benthic species respond to changes in physical factors such as freshwater inflows, salinity, and substrate composition, benthic community data provides an indication of physical changes occurring within the Estuary. Benthic monitoring is an important component of the EMP because operation of the State Water Project can change the Estuary’s flow characteristics, affecting the density and distribution of benthic biota. Benthic monitoring data is also used to detect and document the presence of new, non-native species in the Upper Estuary, such as the 1986 arrival and subsequent wide spread of the overbite clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. This report describes the results of these monitoring efforts for water year `r report_year` (October 1st `r prev_year` through September 30th `r report_year`) `r str_water_year(report_year, 'cur')` [(source)](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=WSIHIST).

## Methods

Benthic monitoring was conducted monthly at 10 sampling sites distributed throughout the Estuary, from San Pablo Bay upstream through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (@fig-stations; @tbl-stations). EMP staff collected four bottom grab samples at each station using a Ponar dredge with a sampling area of 0.052 $m^2$. The four replicate grab samples were analyzed for benthic macrofauna by Hydrozoology, a private laboratory under contract with DWR. All organisms were identified to the lowest taxon possible and enumerated.

dwq_stations <- readr::read_csv(here::here('sections/benthic/tables/benthic_stations.csv'))

styler$style_kable(dwq_stations)
```

The 10 most common genera were determined by summing the normalized organism counts across all stations and months for each genus. For the bar graphs, average organism counts were calculated per month, per region, and normalized to the number of stations. Average summary statistics are reported as the mean (μ) ± the standard deviation.
