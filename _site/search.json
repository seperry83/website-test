    "text": "The Zebra/Quagga Mussel Veliger Monitoring Program monitors zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (Dreissena bugensis) mussel abundance within the Delta. These species were first discovered in Lakes St. Clair and Erie in 1988 and have since expanded their geographic distribution into many other freshwater systems in North America. These mussels were introduced into the Great Lakes by means of discharged ballast water from transoceanic ships that may have contained mussel larvae or possibly juveniles. While zebra and quagga mussels have not been detected in or near the California Delta, the Department of Water Resources’ Zebra and Quagga Mussel Early Detection Monitoring Program aims to monitor the potential spread of zebra and quagga mussels in California waterways. The first stage of the mussel lifecycle is called a veliger, which is a free-swimming planktonic larva that develops miniature bivalve shells and feeds by utilizing its hair-like cilia. Veligers drift with the currents and eventually settle onto hard substrates using sticky secretions. Once settled, they are considered juveniles that eventually develop to sexual maturity, becoming adult mussels after about a year of growth.\nZebra and quagga mussels have negative impacts on aquatic food webs by filtering increased amounts of phytoplankton, which then creates a food source deficiency for organisms in higher trophic levels. They also excrete unwanted particulate matter (pseudofeces) that undergoes decomposition, which causes oxygen levels to decrease and toxic byproducts (ammonia and hydrogen sulfide) to be released into the water. Zebra and quagga mussels also influence industrial processes by colonizing hard surfaces, placing potential limitations on pumping plants for water distribution. This program sets out to monitor any traces of zebra and quagga mussel veliger DNA throughout the California water system to prevent the negative effects associated with the spread of these introduced mussels."

Sampling for this region takes place once a month at each of the three monitoring stations displayed on the map. At each station, a 45-meter horizontal surface tow is conducted using a 64-micron mesh plankton net. The material collected at the cod end of the net is that of which cannot pass through the 64-micron mesh. These particulates are rinsed into a sample container and submitted to a laboratory for PCR analysis, which determines presence/absence of zebra/quagga mussel veliger DNA. In order to sample all three stations in one day, some nets require decontamination in the field prior to reuse. This decontamination process consists of soaking each net in vinegar for a minimum of one hour and then spraying all surfaces of the net with a 10% bleach solution."

    "text": "Program History\nEMP was formed in response to water quality objectives set by California’s State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Suisun, and San Pablo Bays. The data collected and analyzed by EMP scientists is essential for the effective management of water resources in the estuary and assures that the objectives mandated by SWRCB in the permits issued to DWR and UBSR are met. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels in the Delta. The regulatory basis for what became EMP began in 1971 when the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary in Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This decision provided the terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to evaluate changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. A monitoring program was first implemented in 1971 following the design laid out by the Stanford Research Institute (SWRCB Publication 40). These water quality standards were amended in 1978 (D-1485) and again in 1999 (D-1641). The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the requirements of the latter. The annual reports displayed on this website constitute the annual reports submitted to SWRCB by DWR and USBR in fulfillment of the D-1641 reporting requirement."

    "text": "Interpretations\nWater year 2023 in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys was classified as wet after three years of drought. Many atmospheric river storms brought considerable amounts of rain starting in late December and colder average temperatures contributed to record snowpack.\nSpecific conductance had a notable drop in all regions in January due to the influx of freshwater. Most regions continued to have low values throughout the rest of the water year due to snowpack runoff. The San Pablo, Suisun, and Grizzly Bay regions typically have higher values due to the strong marine influence from the Pacific Ocean, and they started to increase again in July. The average specific conductance in water year 2023 was much lower than the previous year. Turbidity had a notable spike in all regions in January due to sediment re-suspension caused by the high flows after a long dry period. Every region (except the Central Delta) had maximum values above 100 FNU. The average turbidity in water year 2023 was higher than the previous year.\nDissolved ammonia, dissolved nitrate + nitrite, and total phosphorus had a notable spike in all regions in January due to increased runoff of organic matter and pollutants. The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest values of all three nutrients likely due to nearby agricultural land use. The average of each nutrient in water year 2023 was similar to the previous year.\nChlorophyll a followed seasonal trends in most regions with higher values in the warmer summer months. The San Pablo Bay region had a small harmful algal bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo in July. C10A in the Southern Interior Delta had a spike in August, which is typically shallow during dry periods of the year. The average chlorophyll a in water year 2023 was a little higher than the previous year. More information about the phytoplankton genera is described in the phytoplankton section."

    "text": "Water quality is a measure of chemical and physical water conditions relative to the needs for aquatic and human life and is closely linked to the surrounding ecosystem and land use. Aquatic plants require suitable light, nutrients, and water temperatures to survive. Aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to breathe, and rely on adequate water temperature, salinity, and pH to survive. Humans need fresh water for recreation, irrigation, as well as to drink. Because of these competing needs, water quality is not easily defined as “good” or “bad,” since it depends on who is using it. However, water quality monitoring is a way for scientists to understand the health of our aquatic ecosystem and to help balance the needs of all who use it.\nTypically, water quality is defined by regulated standards set by a regulatory agency, like the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). If water quality does not meet the regulated standards, then it can be defined as poor. Water quality can be monitored continuously or in a discrete manner, both of which are done by the Environmental Monitoring Program. Discrete water quality monitoring is conducted less frequently than continuous and provides a snapshot into the water conditions at a single moment in time, which is helpful for documenting long-term trends. This type of sampling involves collecting a large quantity of water samples on a monthly basis to be analyzed for numerous water quality tests by a chemical laboratory. The Environmental Monitoring Program monitors 24 fixed discrete water quality stations within the San Francisco Estuary. These stations are sampled monthly at high water slack tide and are primarily accessed by the Research Vessel Sentinel, or by vehicle transport for shore-based stations. Sampling at each of these stations consists of collecting a variety of physical parameters (e.g. water temperature and pH) and grab samples for laboratory analysis (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
