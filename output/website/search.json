    "text": "Methods\nZooplankton have been sampled since 1972, once or twice per month from March to November through 1994, and monthly from 1995 to the present, except during the COVID-19 pandemic, which precluded sampling in March and April 2020 and from December 2020 to February 2021. Samples are collected at 20 fixed stations and up to four floating stations representing the entrapment zone in the upper SFE (Figure 1) using three gear types that target different size ranges of zooplankton: utility pump (1/10 hp, 12V) samples filtered through a 43-micron mesh net for micro-zooplankton (rotifers, copepod nauplii, and small cyclopoid copepods); Clarke-Bumpus (CB) net with 160-micron mesh to sample meso-zooplankton (cladocerans and most juvenile and adult calanoid copepods); and mysid net with 505-micron mesh targeting mysid shrimp and other macro-zooplankton. The mysid and CB nets are mounted on the same tow sled and samples are collected in a 10-minute stepped oblique tow over the depth range of each station.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Map of EMP’s zooplankton field sites.\n\n\n\n\nCatch per unit effort (CPUE) is calculated using the volume of water filtered during a net tow. Volume filtered during mysid and CB tows is determined using a General Oceanics flowmeter mounted in the mouth of each net and calculated as:\n\\[V=(endmeter−startmeter)k∗a\\]\nwhere V is the volume of water sampled (mL), k is the flow meter constant, and a is the area of the mouth of the net (m2).\nThe pump samples 19.8 gallons over the upper 30’ of the water column, filtered through a 43-micron mesh net. All zooplankton samples are preserved immediately after collection in 10% formalin with rose bengal dye. Target organisms in each sample are identified and counted in the laboratory using dissecting microscopes. More information about the sampling and processing methods can be found in the metadata here.\nAbundance indices are calculated for each organism from its target gear type (noted above). Abundance is reported as mean CPUE, calculated as the number of each organism collected per cubic meter of water sampled:\n\\[CPUE=s∗V^{−1}\\]\nwhere s is the estimated count of the target organism in the sample.\nCalanoid and cyclopoid copepod abundance indices reported here comprise adults only, as juveniles cannot always be identified to species. Annual and monthly abundance indices were calculated using 16 fixed stations sampled consistently since 1974 (Figure 1) and 2 to 4 non-fixed entrapment zone (EZ) stations, located where bottom specific conductance was 2 and 6 millisiemens per centimeter (approximately 1 and 3 psu). Note that the number of EZ stations varied as the location of an EZ station may have overlapped with a fixed sampling station.\nTo analyze long-term trends (1974 to present), annual abundance indices were calculated as the mean CPUE for samples collected from March through November, as winter sampling was inconsistent before 1995. Monthly abundances from 2023 are also shown by regions, as detailed in each section below. Estuary regions are designated as San Pablo Bay (stations D41, D41A, 325), Suisun & Grizzly Bays (stations 2, 4, D6, 28, 48), Suisun Marsh (stations 32, S42), Confluence (stations 54, 60, 64, 74), Central Delta (stations D16, D19, 86, D28, M10), North Delta (68), and South Delta (92) (Figure 1). Non-fixed EZ stations were assigned to a geographic region based on their location, which was most often in the Confluence region in 2023, with a few in the Central Delta and North Delta, usually during fall and early winter. In September and December of 2023, two EZ stations were sampled in the San Joaquin River in addition to the two EZ stations in the Sacramento River. Annual indices include data from the 16 core stations and the two Sacramento River EZ stations. Monthly CPUE by region for 2023 includes data from all fixed and non-fixed EZ stations."

    "section": "Trends",
    "text": "Trends\nThe overall abundance of zooplankton in the estuary has decreased significantly over the course of the Zooplankton Study (Figure 3). Cyclopoid copepods are the only group that has increased in abundance over the study period, driven by the invasion and spread of Limnoithona tetraspina. The overall decrease in zooplankton abundance can be attributed to invasive species colonizing the estuary, most notably the Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis in the mid-1980s (Kimmerer et al. 1994; Carlton et al. 1990). Abundances of both phytoplankton and zooplankton in the upper estuary have been impacted by the proliferation of P. amurensis, as it is a highly efficient filter feeder and consumes phytoplankton and small zooplankton, including copepod nauplii. In addition to decreased abundance of most zooplankton groups, community compositions have changed dramatically during the study period, driven by a combination of the introduction and spread of non-native species and changes in the abiotic and biotic environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalanoid Copepods\nAdult calanoid copepod abundance declined only slightly over the study period, but their community composition changed dramatically (Figure 3). When the study began in the early 1970s, the calanoid copepod community was dominated by Acartia spp and an introduced species in the genus Eurytemora (initially identified as E. affinis (Esterly 1924), now considered E. carolleeae (Alekseev & Soussi 2011), referenced in this report as Eurytemora spp.). Even though Eurytemora spp. is not native, it was once the primary prey of the endangered Delta Smelt. However, as its abundance declined, fish increasingly preyed on more recently introduced calanoids like Pseudodiaptomus forbesi (Moyle et al. 1992; Slater and Baxter 2014).\nOne of the first recorded calanoid copepod introductions was Sinocalanus doerrii, a freshwater species native to China that invaded the estuary in 1978 and remained the most dominant calanoid species for a decade (Orsi et al. 1983). The calanoid P. forbesi was first detected by this study in October 1987 (Orsi and Walter 1991), shortly after the Potamocorbula amurensis invasion in the mid-1980s (Kimmerer et al. 1994; Carlton 1990). Combined effects of these introductions may have influenced subsequent abundance declines of E. affinis and S. doerrii. P. forbesi quickly became the numerically dominant calanoid in the upper estuary and remains the most abundant to this day. The predatory calanoid copepod Acartiella sinensis was introduced in 1993 and soon became the second most abundant calanoid in the upper estuary, dominating the low-salinity zone in the Suisun Marsh and Confluence regions (Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). This invasion appears to have narrowed the range of P. forbesi towards freshwater areas of the estuary, potentially in relation to A. sinensis predation on P. forbesi nauplii (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017).\nAside from the 25-year high in calanoid copepod abundance in 2017, total abundance was similar from 1995 to 2023 (Figure 3). After declines in 2021 and 2022, total abundance of calanoid copepods increased in 2023 to essentially the same level as 2020, but with higher proportion of P. forbesi and lower proportion of A. sinensis (Figure 3)\nDistribution of calanoids throughout the estuary in 2023 differed from recent years, likely in response to increased outflow in winter and spring of 2023 (Figure 2). Calanoid abundances, including Eurytemora spp., were very low from January through May in the upstream regions of the Delta (South, Central, and North Delta, and Confluence) (Figure 4), in contrast with seasonal distribution patterns from the drought years 2020 through 2022 that showed Eurytemora spp. as the most common calanoid taxon in these regions in spring (see link in Reference section to zooplankton annual reports 2013-2022). Similar to recent years, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi was dominant in these regions but abundances were low until June or July whereas in prior years abundances increased starting in March. P. forbesi inhabits low salinity waters so this species is typically rare in downstream regions but was fairly abundant in June and July in Suisun Marsh and Suisun and Grizzly Bay and even present in San Pablo Bay in June. P. forbesi was abundant in the North Delta in July but calanoids were low in all other months in this region. In the Confluence region, P. forbesi abundance was high in July and decreased in subsequent months in the presence of increasing numbers of the predatory Acartiella sinensis (Figure 4). Abundance of A. sinensis was highest in the Confluence region in August, and also increased starting in August in the Suisun Marsh and Suisun and Grizzly Bay regions. In these three regions, A. sinensis co-occurred with high densities of one of its primary prey items, Limnoithona tetraspina (Figure 5). P. forbesi abundance was high in Suisun Marsh in June and July 2023 in contrast with low abundances in this region during the drought years from 2020 through 2022 (see link in Reference section to previous zooplankton annual reports).\nThere is a marked difference in the calanoid community in the lower reaches of the estuary when compared to the Delta. Acartia spp. was the only native calanoid commonly found in 2023. These copepods prefer brackish water and were present year-round in San Pablo Bay, though monthly abundances were highly variable (Figure 4). In Suisun and Grizzly Bays, Acartia spp. were abundant only in February, while Eurytemora spp., which are typically rare in this region, were abundant from February through June. In 2022 Tortanus spp. were abundant in this region throughout the year (see link in Reference section to previous zooplankton annual reports), but in 2023 they were essentially absent until June (Figure 4). Tortanus spp. abundances are typically low in San Pablo Bay but comprised over 80% of the copepod community in May and June 2023 and over 50% in July 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyclopoid Copepods\nIn contrast with the general decline of most zooplankton groups during the study period, adult cyclopoid copepods increased dramatically, particularly from 2012 to 2022 (Figure 3). However, in 2023 cyclopoid copepod abundance declined to about half the average for the previous decade (Figure 3), likely in relation to these small organisms being transported downstream from the upper estuary by high freshwater outflow during the early part of 2023 (Figure 2).\nAbundances of Oithona spp. and Acanthocyclops copepods were very low when the study began (Figure 3), and the increase in cyclopoid abundance resulted from the introduction of Limnoithona sinensis in the early 1980s and subsequent identification of the invasive Limnoithona tetraspina in 1993 (Ferrari and Orsi 1984; Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). These two species were reported together as Limnoithona spp. from 1980 through 2006. Limnoithona were identified to species starting in 2007, leading to the discovery that L. tetraspina is by far the dominant species. In 2023, L. tetraspina comprised 99.9% of all Limnoithona collected. For the sake of consistency, abundances are combined and reported here as Limnoithona spp. In 2023, Limnoithona spp. was by far the most abundant copepod group collected by this study (Figure 3).\nThe increase in L. tetraspina abundance may be related to decreased predation due to the decline of Northern Anchovy in the upper SFE (Kimmerer 2006). In addition, the small size, high growth rate, and motionless behavior of L. tetraspina may decrease its vulnerability to predation in a region where most fish are visual predators (Bouley and Kimmerer 2006, Kimmerer 2006). The introduction of L. tetraspina is linked to P. forbesi distribution shifting out of the low-salinity zone of the estuary, as higher densities of L. tetraspina may sustain larger populations of the predatory A. sinensis, which also preys on P. forbesi nauplii (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017).\nAlthough Limnoithona spp. were the most abundant cyclopoids in 2023, their distributional patterns differed from previous years. From January through May cyclopoids were essentially absent from all regions of the estuary except Suisun and Grizzly Bays and San Pablo Bay (Figure 5) and abundances remained low in the South, Central, and North Delta regions throughout the year. Limnoithona spp. abundances increased in the Confluence, Suisun Marsh, and Suisun and Grizzly Bay regions starting in July (Figure 5) and monthly patterns were similar to those of P. forbesi in these regions. In previous years Limnoithona spp. have been virtually absent from San Pablo Bay, but were abundant in spring and summer in 2023, and declined starting in August with increasing abundance of the introduced Oithona davisae, typically the most abundant cyclopoid in this region (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCladocerans\nCladocerans in the upper estuary primarily comprised species in the genera Bosmina, Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, and Diaphanosoma. Their populations have declined substantially during the study period (Figure 3), although there has been somewhat of an increasing trend since the late 1990s. Cladocerans are largely herbivorous and feed primarily on phytoplankton, so likely were impacted by the invasion of P. amurensis (Baxter et al. 2008; Greene et al. 2011, Kratina and Winder 2015). Throughout the upper estuary, cladocerans comprise a significant portion of Delta Smelt and juvenile Chinook Salmon diets (Slater and Baxter 2014; Goertler et al. 2018) and were historically an important food source for young-of-the-year Striped Bass (Heubach et al. 1963). Increased abundances of invasive copepods such as P. forbesi and the declines in native cladocerans may alter the nutritional content of the planktonic prey available to fish (Kratina and Winder 2015).\nIn the early years of the study, the cladoceran community was dominated by Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia spp (Figure 3). Over the last decade, the cladoceran community shifted to higher proportions of Ceriodaphnia spp. and Diaphanosoma spp., although B. longirostris and Daphnia spp. are still present (Figure 3). Cladoceran abundance declined in 2023, with Diaphanosoma spp. and B. longirostris the most abundant taxa (Figure 3).Cladoceran abundances in the early months of 2023 were higher than during the same period in 2022 (see link in Reference section to previous zooplankton annual reports) in all regions except the South and Central Delta, with Bosmina longirostris the dominant species (Figure 6). Increased downstream distribution of cladocerans is consistent with high outflow conditions (Figure 2). Abundances in downstream regions decreased by late spring and early summer and increased in the South and Central Delta regions in August (Figure 6), though maximum abundances in 2023 (maximum CPUE ~8,000) were quite a bit lower than in 2022 (maximum CPUE ~30,000). In the South and Central Delta, low abundances of cladocerans in the early months of the year comprised B. longirostris, Daphnia spp. and the “other” category. In August, Diaphanosoma abundances were high in the South Delta along with B. longirostris and Daphnia spp. Diaphanosoma abundances were also high in the Central Delta in August and September, along with smaller numbers of B. longirostris and Ceriodaphnia. In the Confluence and North Delta, abundances were highest January through May and comprised all taxa except Diaphanosoma, while summer abundances of all taxa were very low but Diaphanosoma were present (Figure 6). In Suisun and Grizzly Bays and Suisun Marsh, cladocerans, largely B. longirostris, were present in winter and spring months but all taxa were essentially absent after June. In San Pablo Bay cladoceran abundances were low throughout the year, with B. longirostris collected in March but not abundant relative to the upstream regions, all taxa essentially absent May through July, and only “Other Cladocera” present starting in August.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotifers\nAlthough rotifers are the most abundant type of zooplankton in the upper estuary, their abundance decreased dramatically since the start of the study (Figure 3). However, rotifer abundance increased in 2023 relative to the previous few years (Figure 3). Interestingly, the decline in rotifer abundance began in the late 1970s, preceding the invasion by P. amurensis (Cloern and Jassby 2012). The rotifer community comprises species from the genera Polyarthra, Synchaeta, Keratella, and Trichocerca, as well as the “other” rotifer category, which includes the genus Asplanchna.\nRotifer abundance increased in 2023 after several years of very low abundances, to a level similar to 2019 (Figure 3). Synchaeta spp. were the most abundant, with smaller numbers of Synchaeta bicornis, Polyarthra spp. and Keratella spp. (Figure 3). Keratella and Polyarthra tended to be most abundant in freshwater and low-salinity regions (Figure 7), their preferred habitats (Winder and Jassby 2011). Increased abundances of these taxa in Suisun Marsh and Suisun and Grizzly Bays in the winter and spring of 2023 suggest fresher than usual conditions, though Synchaeta spp. co-occurred with them in all regions including San Pablo Bay. A spatial and temporal split was discernible between Synchaeta and the other rotifer groups, with highest densities of Synchaeta spp. in Suisun Marsh, Suisun and Grizzly Bays, and San Pablo Bay during winter and spring months. There was a noticeable increase in S. bicornis abundance in July in Suisun and Grizzly Bays, though Synchaeta spp. were also present. The “other” rotifers group was most abundant in the South and Central Delta during summer (Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMysids\nMysid abundances were higher overall during the first 12 years of the Zooplankton Study, with the highest abundance in 1986 (Figure 3). Annual abundances have varied from 2.1 to 29.4 (mean 12.3) from 1987 to present, with the 2023 annual CPUE of 13.1 about half that of 2022 (Figure 3) but slightly higher than the mean over this period. In addition to an overall decline since the inception of the study, the community composition shifted dramatically. Prior to 1994, the native Neomysis mercedis was the most abundant species but since 1994 the mysid community has been dominated by the introduced Hyperacanthomysis longirostris (formerly Acanthomysis bowmani) (Figure 3). N. mercedis declined significantly during the 1976-1977 drought, likely related to food limitation from a lack of diatoms due to low river discharges (Siegfried et al. 1979; Cloern et al. 1983). N. mercedis populations rebounded after the drought and abundances remained high in the Suisun Bay region until the introduction of P. amurensis in the mid-1980s, after which their numbers declined dramatically and remained low (Orsi 1999). The mysid community in 2023 was dominated by H. longirostris, along with a small proportion of Neomysis kadiakensis. H. longirostris remained the most common mysid in the upper estuary, while the abundance of the once dominant native species N. mercedis remained low, continuing the overall trend in mysid community composition since 1994.\nThe introduced mysid H. longirostris was first detected by this study in 1993, shortly after the decline of N. mercedis. Although H. longirostris quickly became the most common mysid in the system, total mysid abundances have not returned to their pre-clam (Potamocorbula amurensis) invasion levels (Modlin and Orsi 1997, Figure 3). Historically mysids have been critically important in the diets of many fish species in the upper SFE, including Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Striped Bass, and Chinook Salmon (Moyle et al. 1992; Feyrer et al. 2003; CDFG 2009; Goertler et al. 2018). The decline of mysids in the upper estuary led to a significant decrease in their presence in fish diets (Feyrer et al. 2003).\nIn 2023 H. longirostris, was most common in the low-salinity zone of Suisun Marsh (Figure 8). Although abundances of the native N. mercedis remain very low, representatives of this species were found in all regions except Suisun and Grizzly Bays in 2023. Mysids were moderately abundant in the Confluence region from July to September. From January through April, mysids were essentially absent from all regions except Suisun and Grizzly Bays and San Pablo Bay, likely due to very high freshwater outflow (Figure 2). Aside from high abundances in Suisun Marsh in August and Suisun and Grizzly Bays in May, mysid abundances were low in all regions in other months. The mysid community in San Pablo Bay typically comprises the “other” species (Acanthomysis aspera, Acanthomysis hwanhaiensis, and Alienacanthomysis macropsis) but in 2023 the “other” group was essentially absent except in January. H. longirostris and N. kadiakensis were the predominant species from March through June, and all mysids were largely absent after July (Figure 8). Note that this study samples only the upper portion of San Pablo Bay, so these findings do not represent mysid community dynamics in other areas of San Pablo Bay."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn 2023, the Zooplankton Study recorded calanoids, cladocerans, rotifers, and mysids at abundances consistent with the historic downward trends in the estuary. There were clear effects of high freshwater outflow on zooplankton distribution patterns during the early months of 2023. Abundances of all zooplankton groups peaked in summer of 2023, and rotifer abundances were also high in spring (March to May). The small, introduced Limnoithona tetraspina remained the most abundant copepod in the upper estuary. Mysid abundance declined in 2023 compared to 2022 and the community remained dominated by the introduced Hypercanthomysis longirostris, in comparison to the pre-1987 community, which was dominated by the native Neomysis mercedis.\nThis multi-decade Zooplankton Study allows researchers and managers to track shifts in zooplankton abundances and community composition in the upper estuary for over five decades. The Zooplankton Study has documented the introduction and dominance of Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Limnoithona tetraspina, and Hypercanthomysis longirostris, as well as the community’s response to the invasive clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Understanding these dynamics and how they have fundamentally changed trophic interactions is critical to assessing conservation strategies and food resources for fish in the upper San Francisco Estuary."

Sampling for this region takes place once a month at each of the three monitoring stations displayed on the map. At each station, a 45-meter horizontal surface tow is conducted using a 64-micron mesh plankton net. The material collected at the cod end of the net is that of which cannot pass through the 64-micron mesh. These particulates are rinsed into a sample container and submitted to a laboratory for PCR analysis, which determines presence/absence of zebra/quagga mussel veliger DNA. In order to sample all three stations in one day, some nets require decontamination in the field prior to reuse. This decontamination process consists of soaking each net in vinegar for a minimum of one hour and then spraying all surfaces of the net with a 10% bleach solution."

    "section": "Why are phytoplankton important?",
    "text": "Why are phytoplankton important?\nPhytoplankton are the foundation of the aquatic food web. They feed a diverse array of organisms, ranging from microscopic zooplankton to large pelagic fish. Small fish and benthic organisms also graze on phytoplankton, and are in turn consumed by larger organisms such as birds. Because of their importance as the base of the food web, changes in phytoplankton in the San Francisco Estuary can have cascading effects throughout the food web. For example, loss of phytoplankton species that are important food sources can negatively affect the zooplankton and fish species that feed on those phytoplankton, and thus negatively affect the animals preying on those zooplankton and fish.\nPhytoplankton can also affect elements of water quality such as pH, dissolved oxygen, taste and odor of drinking water, and water transparency. Large algal blooms, both toxic and non-toxic, can have adverse effects on the water quality parameters listed above. They can also have negative aesthetic effects by forming large, floating surface scums. Monitoring changes in phytoplankton can be useful in assessing water quality trends by detecting the presence of nuisance species or the development of large blooms that could require management action.\nChlorophyll-a is the primary photosynthetic product made by phytoplankton and plants, and gives them their green color. Chlorophyll-a is also a measure of the biomass that is directly available to organisms that prey on phytoplankton, such as clams and zooplankton.\nSometimes the green color is masked by secondary pigments, and these phytoplankton often appear brown or red instead of green. Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting chloro¬phyll-a concentrations in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. Well-established benthic populations of P. amurensis in Suisun and San Pablo bays are thought to have contrib¬uted to the low chlorophyll-a concentrations (and increased water clarity) measured in these westerly bays since the mid-1980s. By removing phytoplankton from the water, P. amurensis has reduced the amount of phytoplankton available to other organisms such as zooplankton."

    "text": "How is phytoplankton monitored?\nThe California DWR Phytoplankton and Chlorophyll-a monitoring measures the composition (what kinds?), abundance (how many?), diversity (how many kinds?), and distribution (where are they?) of phytoplankton. It also measures phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll-a; both types of monitoring are performed as part of the IEP’s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP). Thirteen fixed sites are currently sampled for both phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a, with two additional sites sampled at variable locations based on bottom specific conductance of 2,000 and 6,000 micro-Siemens, respectively. Historically, samples were collected once or twice monthly at up to 33 sites. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a samples are collected monthly alongside the water quality and zooplankton sampling. Whole, unfiltered water samples are collected monthly from one meter below the surface to determine phytoplankton composition; Lugol’s solution is then added as a stain and preservative. For chlorophyll-a samples, water is filtered onto glass carbon fiber filters for analysis. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a data are available from 1975 to the present.\nChanges in phytoplankton composition, abundance, diversity, distribution, and biomass are monitored throughout the San Francisco Estuary, from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne, and San Joaquin Rivers.\nBecause different phytoplankton species live in different parts of the Estuary, the sites represent a wide range of habitats of varying physical conditions, including wide ranges of salinity and temperature. Sites range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays."

    "text": "Interpretations\nWater year 2023 in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys was classified as wet after three years of drought. Many atmospheric river storms brought considerable amounts of rain starting in late December and colder average temperatures contributed to record snowpack.\nSpecific conductance had a notable drop in all regions in January due to the influx of freshwater. Most regions continued to have low values throughout the rest of the water year due to snowpack runoff. The San Pablo, Suisun, and Grizzly Bay regions typically have higher values due to the strong marine influence from the Pacific Ocean, and they started to increase again in July. The average specific conductance in water year 2023 was much lower than the previous year. Turbidity had a notable spike in all regions in January due to sediment re-suspension caused by the high flows after a long dry period. Every region (except the Central Delta) had maximum values above 100 FNU. The average turbidity in water year 2023 was higher than the previous year.\nDissolved ammonia, dissolved nitrate + nitrite, and total phosphorus had a notable spike in all regions in January due to increased runoff of organic matter and pollutants. The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest values of all three nutrients likely due to nearby agricultural land use. The average of each nutrient in water year 2023 was similar to the previous year.\nChlorophyll a followed seasonal trends in most regions with higher values in the warmer summer months. The San Pablo Bay region had a small harmful algal bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo in July. C10A in the Southern Interior Delta had a spike in August, which is typically shallow during dry periods of the year. The average chlorophyll a in water year 2023 was a little higher than the previous year. More information about the phytoplankton genera is described in the phytoplankton section."

    "text": "Interpretations\nWater Year 2023 began as a continuation of the preceding three years of drought conditions, but a deluge of atmospheric rivers beginning in late December and continuing through March brought high amounts of precipitation and a massive snowpack, which resulted in WY 2023 ultimately being classified as Wet.\nThe extreme precipitation events and snowpack runoff led to a considerable drop in specific conductivity in the Delta. The low values persisted through WY 2023 in the Interior Delta regions, with the western regions of Grizzly/Suisun and the Confluence beginning to show a marine influence in July. Cooler than average air temperatures at the start of the water year and runoff from the record snowpack resulted in much cooler water average temperatures. The Water Year 2023 average was 2.1 ºC cooler than the critically dry Water Year 2022. High flows created by the winter storms resulted in high turbidity in January with maximum values in all regions exceeding 100 FNU. A smaller spike in turbidity occurred in March also due to storm runoff."

Of the 185 benthic species collected in WY 2023, the ten most abundant species represented 80% of all individuals collected throughout the year (Figure 2). These include three species of amphipod, two clams, three oligochate worms, one polychate worm, and one cumacean arthropod (also known as a comma shrimp, although it is not actually a shrimp). Only three species in this group (the amphipods Americorophium spinicorne and Hyalella sp., and the oligochaete worm Ilyodrilus franzti) are native to this estuary. The rest of the top ten species are non-native or are cosmopolitan species of unknown origin. Refer to Fields and Messer (1999) for descriptions of the habitat requirements, physical attributes, and feeding methods of many of these species.\nIn the site descriptions that follow, most species densities are reported as the annual densities of individuals/m2, sometimes noting dramatic seasonal peaks. Some species, especially arthropods, display strong seasonal variability with peak monthly densities several times higher than their annual densities. In these cases, we reported the time and magnitude of the peaks as well as the annual densities. Please note that the station P8 was not sampled in December 2022 due to heavy fog, and comparisons to other years’ average annual densities or seasonal patterns should take this omission into account.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: List of ten most numerous benthic invertebrate species found at EMP sites."

    "section": "Regional Results",
    "text": "Regional Results\n\nCentral Delta (D16, D28A)\nThe benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations, in the Central Delta, D16 and D28. Site D16 is on the lower San Joaquin River near Twitchell Island (Figure 1). There were 15 species in four phyla at D16 in WY 2023, split between Mollusca (62% of all organisms collected in 2023) and Arthropoda (37%) (Figure 3). The most abundant species at D16 was the clam Corbicula fluminea which accounted for 58% of all organisms in 2022, with an average annual density of 146 individuals/m2 and peaks in May and August 2023. The amphipod Gammarus daiberi was the second most abundant organism, accounting for 25% of all individuals, with an average annual density of 62 individuals/m2 and a peak in October 2022 of 230 individuals/m2 and another in February of 169 individuals/m2.  Much of the rest of the community was a combination of various species of amphipods and snails at lower densities. The total number of organisms at D16 in WY 2023 continued the trend of very low numbers compared with other years in the previous decade. In particular, WY 2020-2023 saw very low numbers of the amphipod Americorophium spinicorne, which was seen in very high numbers at D16 from 2015-2018.\nThe site on Old River near Rancho Del Rio is known as D28A (Figure 1). In WY 2023, there were 58 species in seven phyla at D28A. The most abundant phylum was Annelida, followed by Arthropoda and Mollusca (55%, 33%, and 12% of all organisms, respectively) (Figure 4). The most abundant species was the oligochaete worm Variachaetadrilus angustipenis with an average density of 1,494 individuals/m2 and high densities between December 2022 and May 2023, followed by the ostracod crustacean Cyprideis sp. A with an average density of 767 individuals/m2 and higher densities between December 2022 and March 2023.  The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea had an annual average density of 356 individuals/m2 that grew from April through July, likely via seasonal recruitment.  While D28A had similarly high species richness in WY 2023 to other years, a few notable differences were fewer of the amphipods Gammarus daiberi and Americorophium spinicorne, which were both more numerous in 2013, 2014, and 2022 than now, as well as many fewer of the sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa, which was the most numerous organism at D28A in several years of the past decade but in WY 2023 comprised just 3.5% of all organisms found here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D28A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfluence (D4)\nSite D4 is located near the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, just north of Point Sacramento (Figure 1). There were 41 species in six phyla at D4, and in WY 2023 this was the site with the highest number of organisms. Arthropoda was by far the most abundant phylum (88% of all organisms) followed by Annelida (7% of all organisms) and Mollusca (6% of all organisms) (Figure 5). The native amphipod Americorophium spinicorne was the most abundant species at this station and made up slightly over 71% of all individual organisms in WY 2023 with a dramatic seasonal peak of 55,279 individuals/m2 in August 2023 and an annual average of 8,436 individuals/m2, the highest annual average in a decade. The non-native amphipod Gammarus daiberi had an annual average of 1,562 individuals/m2, which was at low density before increasing  in June to a seasonal peak in September of 5,380 individuals/m2.  The invasive clam Corbicula fluminea also saw a summer seasonal increase, with a high in August of 1,788 and an annual average of 471 individuals/m2.\nBecause of D4’s position at the front of saltwater and freshwater mixing in the estuary, we often see a shift from the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea to more brackish-water Potamocorbula amurensis following dry years, and the reverse following wet years.  The drought of 2018-2022 led to high Potamocorbula numbers, which abruptly crashed down in WY 2023 while Corbicula increased modestly. 2022 was also notable for its rebound of amphipod A. spinicorne in 2022 from the low of WY 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Pablo Bay (D41, D41A)\nThe benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in San Pablo Bay, D41 and D41A. Station D41 is near Point Pinole (Figure 1) and has a benthic community primarily comprised of marine organisms, especially in drier water years. There were 76 species in seven phyla at D41 in WY 2023. Annelida was the most abundant phylum (37% of all organisms) followed by Phoronida (25%), Arthropoda (24%) and Mollusca (10%) (Figure 6). The single most abundant species was the Phoronis harmeri, a native tube-dwelling filter-feeder from the small marine lophophorate phylum Phoronida, with an average annual density of 490 individuals/m2 and representing 25% of all organisms. The second most abundant species was non-native amphipod Ampelisa abdita, comprising 19% of all organisms with 370 organisms/m2, most of them in a very strong peak in September 2023. The window shell clam Theora lubrica, along with the tube-dwelling polychate worm Pseudopolydora kempi and the polychaete worm Scoletoma luti, were the other species found in notable densities. D41 overall community composition in 2021 was similar to the preceding decade apart from the high numbers of Potamocorbula amurensis from WY 2017-2019,  and the decrease in the amphipod Ampelisca abdita from its very high levels in WY 2018-2021.  This pattern reinforces that higher-salinity water years such as 2021 see increases in more marine species such as Apelisca abdita, Phoronis harmeri, and Theora lubrica but lower numbers of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which prefers more brackish water and is mostly seen at D41 following wetter water years.\nStation D41A is in San Pablo Bay near the mouth of the Petaluma River (Figure 1). There were 51 species in seven phyla at D41A in WY 2023. The most abundant phyla was Arthropoda (39% of all organisms), with Annelida second (31%) and Mollusca third (26%) (Figure 7). The two most numerous species were the small cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon hinumensis , which had an annual average of 557 individuals/m2 and a strong seasonal peak from January-May, and the arthropod Ampelisca abdita, which had an annual average of 338 individuals/m2, almost all of which occurred in August and September 2023. The window shell clam Theora lubrica and the invasive overbite clam Potamocorbula amurensis had seasonally opposed patterns; T. lubrica had its peak in December and was not seen again after January 2023, while P. amurensis did not appear until February and was densest in August, likely because of the opposing effects of the wet winter of WY 2023 on the more marine T. lubrica and the more brackish-water P. amurensis. The community in 2022 was lacking in several species which had been numerically dominant for the previous decade: the amphipods Ampelisca abdita and Monocorophim acherusicum, the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, and the small cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon hinumensis were at some of their lowest levels in the last decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Delta (P8, C9)\nThe benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in the South Delta. Site P8 is on the San Joaquin River at Buckley Cove (Figure 1). Sampling did not occur in December 2022 due to very foggy conditions.  Station P8 had a total of 54 species in five phyla in WY 2023. Annelida was by far the most abundant phyla at this station in 2023, accounting for 90% of all organisms collected (Figure 8). The dominant species driving most of the Annelida patterns was the non-native sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa, which had an annual density of 5,501 individuals/m2 and accounted by itself for 59% of all organisms. Manayunkia speciosa in 2023 increased slightly from its lower densities from 2017 through 2022, but not close to the high densities seen from 2012 to 2016, which peaked at 11,705 individuals/m2 in WY 2016. The oligochate worms Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Varichaetadrilus angustipenis were the next most common organisms at 1,271 and 537individuals/m2 annual density, followed by a long tail of many species represented at low densities. This community composition has remained largely unchanged through the last decade, apart from the dramatic changes in of M. speciosa.\nSite C9 is on Old River at the Clifton Court Forebay intake (Figure 1). There were 85 species in seven phyla at C9 in WY 2023. Annelida was the dominant phylum throughout the year, accounting for 79% of all organisms collected in WY 2023, followed by 15% Arthropoda. (Figure 9). An oligochaete worm, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, made up 28% of all organisms with an annual density of 1,804 individuals/m2, which is roughly a quarter of its decade high value in WY 2012 of 5,454 individuals/m2. The oligochaete worms Varichaetadrilus angustipenis and Ilyodrilus frantzi were the next most numeous, with average densities of 1,755 and 1,670 individuals/m2. Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Ilyodrilus frantzi had their highest densities from May through September 2023.  The freshwater amphipod Hyalella sp. A was also notable with an annual average of 737 individuals/m2 through WY 2023, with two peaks in November 2022 and June 2023. Similar to P8, C9 has a large number of low-density species, including the highest diversity of aquatic insect larvae at any site sampled (23 species in WY 2023, mostly chironomid midges). The community was dominated by oligochaetes and had the same overall composition as it has for many years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station P8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station C9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuisun & Grizzly Bays (D6, D7)\nThe benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in the Suisun Bay area, D6 and D7. Site D6 is in Suisun Bay near the I-680 bridge (Figure 1) and had 28 species in five phyla in WY 2023. Mollusca was the dominant phylum, accounting for 97% of all organisms collected (Figure 10). Most of the organisms collected were the invasive Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which had an annual density of 9,345 individuals/m2, in an increase from its decade-long low in WY 2017 but still below its WY 2020 high of 23,800 individuals/m2. Potamocorbula amurensis was most abundant in August 2023 with 55,548 individuals/m2, likely as a result of summer seasonal recruitment. The relatively few other organisms found at this site were predominately from phylum Arthropoda, either the brackish-water bay barnacle Amphibalanus improvisus, found mostly growing on P. amurensis shells, or the cumacean crustacean Nippoleucon hinumensis.\nSite D7 is in Grizzly Bay, near the entrance to Suisun Slough (Figure 1). There were 29 species in three phyla in WY 2023. Mollusca comprised 64% of the total organisms, Arthropoda 28%, and Annelida 8%. The non-native clam Potamocorbula amurensis and the cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon hinumensis were the two most abundant species, comprising 64% and 21% of the total community through the year, respectively (Figure 11). Nippoleucon hinumensis had an annual density of 673 organisms/m2, but saw a strong seasonal pattern: relatively high densities from October through December and relatively lower densities the rest of the year, including almost none from June through September. Potamocorbula amurensis had an annual average density of 2,085/organisms/m2 and a very strongly seasonal pattern as well – high numbers in October 20022 decreasing through winter and spring, then an abrupt increase in seasonal recruitment in August to 9,284 organisms/m2. While P. amurensis has been numerically dominant through the last decade, a major change in WY 2021 was the rise of N. hinumensis and a simultaneous crash of the amphipod Sinocorophium alienense, which had been the second-densest species at D7 for at least the last decade. Sinocorophium alienense crashed in WY 2021 to around 576 organisms/m2, was completely absent from D7 in WY 2022, and barely appeared in WY 2023 at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D7."

    "text": "Interpretations\nIn summary, WY 2023 saw the second lowest average organism density of any year of the past decade, second only to WY 2022. This trend was consistent across most sites, and was caused largely by the decrease in various amphipod species, especially Ampelisca abdita in San Pablo Bay and Sinocorophium alienense in Grizzly Bay, as well as the decrease in the sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa at Central Delta sites. Since many fish species have switched to amphipod food sources after the collapse of mysid shrimps (Feyrer et al. 2003), the near disappearance of various amphipod species may have food web implications unless they have simply shifted their ranges out of our sampling area. Densities of the non-native clams Potamocorbula amurensis and Corbicula fluminea were also near decade lows in WY 2023, possibly because of the wet water year 2023, which caused clams to shift ranges downstream and their numbers to be depressed until they could recruit in the following warm season to their new salinity ranges.  Ordinarily, the decrease of both species of invasive clams and their filter-feeding activity would be a favorable sign for the ecosystem, but the relative absence of several other numerically dominant members of the community in WY 2023 has unclear implications. Our ability to recognize these changes over decadal timescales highlights the importance of continued monitoring of benthic invertebrates to a high taxonomic resolution across the entire estuarine salinity gradient, as the community interacts with both various abiotic conditions as well as key parts of the estuarine food web."

    "text": "Program History\nEMP was formed in response to water quality objectives set by California’s State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Suisun, and San Pablo Bays. The data collected and analyzed by EMP scientists is essential for the effective management of water resources in the estuary and assures that the objectives mandated by SWRCB in the permits issued to DWR and UBSR are met. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels in the Delta. The regulatory basis for what became EMP began in 1971 when the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary in Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This decision provided the terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to evaluate changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. A monitoring program was first implemented in 1971 following the design laid out by the Stanford Research Institute (SWRCB Publication 40). These water quality standards were amended in 1978 (D-1485) and again in 1999 (D-1641). The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the requirements of the latter. The annual reports displayed on this website constitute the annual reports submitted to SWRCB by DWR and USBR in fulfillment of the D-1641 reporting requirement."

    "text": "Benthic organisms are creatures that live at the bottom of water bodies. This includes invertebrates (animals without backbones) like clams, shrimp, crabs, worms, aquatic insects, and small crustaceans called amphipods. Some benthic organisms live in or on the soft mud of the San Francisco Estuary, while others attach themselves to rocks and other hard surfaces. There are also benthic vertebrates (animals with backbones) that include various fish species.\nBenthic organisms are a central part of the estuarine food web, consuming and consumed by other creatures. Every winter during low-tides, thousands of migrating shorebirds feast upon uncovered clams, crabs, and worms found in the mudflats. Humans can also take advantage of the low tides to harvest these organisms. Certain fish species, including juvenile salmon, striped bass, and sturgeon, also consume many types of benthic organisms.\nA large percentage of the benthic organisms found in the San Francisco Estuary are non-native, and some of these species can have negative effects on the health of the estuary. For example, non-native clams can filter out much of the available phytoplankton, outcompeting the zooplankton who in turn are major sources of fish food. Historically, shrimp supported a large commercial fishery in San Francisco Estuary, and California’s commercial Dungeness crab fishery still depends upon crabs that spend the first two years of their life growing in the San Francisco Estuary.\nChanges in benthic organisms’ populations can be indications of larger changes in the physical conditions and water quality of the San Francisco Estuary, including alterations in pollution levels, freshwater inflows, salinity, and sediment composition."

    "title": "Discrete Water Quality Background",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Water quality is a measure of chemical and physical water conditions relative to the needs for aquatic and human life and is closely linked to the surrounding ecosystem and land use. Aquatic plants require suitable light, nutrients, and water temperatures to survive. Aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to breathe, and rely on adequate water temperature, salinity, and pH to survive. Humans need fresh water for recreation, irrigation, as well as to drink. Because of these competing needs, water quality is not easily defined as “good” or “bad,” since it depends on who is using it. However, water quality monitoring is a way for scientists to understand the health of our aquatic ecosystem and to help balance the needs of all who use it.\nTypically, water quality is defined by regulated standards set by a regulatory agency, like the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). If water quality does not meet the regulated standards, then it can be defined as poor. Water quality can be monitored continuously or in a discrete manner, both of which are done by the Environmental Monitoring Program. Discrete water quality monitoring is conducted less frequently than continuous and provides a snapshot into the water conditions at a single moment in time, which is helpful for documenting long-term trends. This type of sampling involves collecting a large quantity of water samples on a monthly basis to be analyzed for numerous water quality tests by a chemical laboratory. The Environmental Monitoring Program monitors 24 fixed discrete water quality stations within the San Francisco Estuary. These stations are sampled monthly at high water slack tide and are primarily accessed by the Research Vessel Sentinel, or by vehicle transport for shore-based stations. Sampling at each of these stations consists of collecting a variety of physical parameters (e.g. water temperature and pH) and grab samples for laboratory analysis (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous)."

    "text": "Interpretations\nOverall, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin-a, and phytoplankton abundance followed a seasonal pattern with the highest values of pigments and abundances in the spring and summer months and lower values and abundances in winter months. One exception was a large cyanobacterial bloom in January 2023 which occurred across all regions. However, this bloom was not associated with larger chlorophyll-a values, suggesting that, while the cyanobacteria were abundant, they were not producing large amounts of biomass as chlorophyll-a. Though cyanobacteria were dominant in the abundance counts, all phytoplankton fell into 12 distinct taxonomic groups distributed across all the regions of the San Francisco Estuary. Chlorophyll-a values were low throughout the year across all regions, with the majority of values below 10 µg/L, which is considered food limiting for zooplankton."

    "text": "Zooplankton in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) serve as a vital link between aquatic primary producers and higher trophic level consumers. As primary consumers of phytoplankton, zooplankton facilitate the flow of carbon through the large and complex SFE food web (Schroeter et al. 2015; Kimmerer et al. 2018) that historically supported abundant fisheries. Zooplankton in the SFE are a key food source for endangered fish species, notably the Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) (Hobbs et al. 2006; Slater and Baxter 2014). Many species of fish, including Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) feed on zooplankton in the estuary as larvae and juveniles (Goertler et al. 2018; Heubach et al. 1963), while others like Northern Anchovy (Engraulis mordax), Tule Perch (Hysterocarpus traskii) and Prickly Sculpin (Cottus asper) include zooplankton in their diets throughout their lifetimes (Kimmerer 2006, Feyrer et al. 2003).\nThe importance of zooplankton in the estuarine food web prompted the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1972 to assess the prey resources available to fish in the upper SFE. Mandated by the State Water Resources Control Board’s Water Right Decision 1641, the study is conducted jointly by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department of Water Resources under the guidance and management of the Interagency Ecological Program. For over five decades this study has monitored the zooplankton community in the region, tracking abundance trends and distribution patterns, detecting and monitoring introduced species, and documenting dramatic shifts in community composition. Changes in zooplankton abundance and composition have been linked to major declines in pelagic fishes in the upper estuary (Sommer et al. 2007; Winder and Jassby 2011)."
