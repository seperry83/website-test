## Introduction

The Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) are required by Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) to collect discrete water chemistry data to monitor the water quality at select sites in the upper San Francisco Estuary (Estuary). This report describes the results of these monitoring efforts for water year `r report_year` (October 1st `r prev_year` through September 30th `r report_year`), which was classified as a `r water_year()` year in the Sacramento Valley [(source)](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=WSIHIST). Results are compared to the previous water year (October 1st `r prev_year-1` through September 30th `r prev_year`), which was classified as a `r water_year(prev_year)` year.

## Methods

Discrete water quality samples were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the Upper Estuary and were grouped into regions based on their geographic location (Figure 1; Table 1). These sites represent a variety of aquatic habitats, from narrow, freshwater channels to broad, estuarine bays.

EMP collects data for six different field parameters and 18 different laboratory constituents. The analytes highlighted in this report are:

-   Specific Conductance
-   Turbidity
-   Dissolved Ammonia
-   Chlorophyll *a*
-   Dissolved Nitrate+Nitrite
-   Total Phosphorus

Regional facet graphs were created for each parameter. The minimum and maximum values were determined for each field parameter or laboratory analyte to show that year's range. When this occurred, for the corresponding graph, a vertical dashed line capped at the reporting limit was used to represent the presence of a non-detect. Average summary statistics are reported as the median (M) ± the median average deviation.

## Results

### Specific Conductance

The average specific conductance value was 2.08 ± x μg/L which was lower than the previous year average (M = 2.37 ± x μg/L). Values ranged from \< 0.5 μg/L (the reporting limit) to 65.2 μg/L (D41A in San Pablo Bay, August). Per region average, minimum, and maximum values are shown in Table x; time series plots are shown in Figure y.”

```

### Turbidity

The average turbidity value was 2.08 ± x μg/L which was lower than the previous year average (M = 2.37 ± x μg/L). Values ranged from \< 0.5 μg/L (the reporting limit) to 65.2 μg/L (D41A in San Pablo Bay, August). Per region average, minimum, and maximum values are shown in Table x; time series plots are shown in Figure y.”

```

### Dissolved Ammonia

The average dissolved ammonia value was 2.08 ± x μg/L which was lower than the previous year average (M = 2.37 ± x μg/L). Values ranged from \< 0.5 μg/L (the reporting limit) to 65.2 μg/L (D41A in San Pablo Bay, August). y% of samples were below the reporting limit. Per region average, minimum, and maximum values are shown in Table x; time series plots are shown in Figure y.”

```

### Chlorophyll *a*

The average specific chlorophyll *a* value was 2.08 ± x μg/L which was lower than the previous year average (M = 2.37 ± x μg/L). Values ranged from \< 0.5 μg/L (the reporting limit) to 65.2 μg/L (D41A in San Pablo Bay, August). y% of samples were below the reporting limit. Per region average, minimum, and maximum values are shown in Table x; time series plots are shown in Figure y.”

### Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite

The average dissolved nitrate + nitrite value was 2.08 ± x μg/L which was lower than the previous year average (M = 2.37 ± x μg/L). Values ranged from \< 0.5 μg/L (the reporting limit) to 65.2 μg/L (D41A in San Pablo Bay, August). y% of samples were below the reporting limit. Per region average, minimum, and maximum values are shown in Table x; time series plots are shown in Figure y.”

```

### Total Phosphorus

The average total phosphorus value was 2.08 ± x μg/L which was lower than the previous year average (M = 2.37 ± x μg/L). Values ranged from \< 0.5 μg/L (the reporting limit) to 65.2 μg/L (D41A in San Pablo Bay, August). y% of samples were below the reporting limit. Per region average, minimum, and maximum values are shown in Table x; time series plots are shown in Figure y.”
