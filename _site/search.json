    "text": "The Zebra/Quagga Mussel Veliger Monitoring Program monitors zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (Dreissena bugensis) mussel abundance within the Delta. These species were first discovered in Lakes St. Clair and Erie in 1988 and have since expanded their geographic distribution into many other freshwater systems in North America. These mussels were introduced into the Great Lakes by means of discharged ballast water from transoceanic ships that may have contained mussel larvae or possibly juveniles. While zebra and quagga mussels have not been detected in or near the California Delta, the Department of Water Resources’ Zebra and Quagga Mussel Early Detection Monitoring Program aims to monitor the potential spread of zebra and quagga mussels in California waterways. The first stage of the mussel lifecycle is called a veliger, which is a free-swimming planktonic larva that develops miniature bivalve shells and feeds by utilizing its hair-like cilia. Veligers drift with the currents and eventually settle onto hard substrates using sticky secretions. Once settled, they are considered juveniles that eventually develop to sexual maturity, becoming adult mussels after about a year of growth.\nZebra and quagga mussels have negative impacts on aquatic food webs by filtering increased amounts of phytoplankton, which then creates a food source deficiency for organisms in higher trophic levels. They also excrete unwanted particulate matter (pseudofeces) that undergoes decomposition, which causes oxygen levels to decrease and toxic byproducts (ammonia and hydrogen sulfide) to be released into the water. Zebra and quagga mussels also influence industrial processes by colonizing hard surfaces, placing potential limitations on pumping plants for water distribution. This program sets out to monitor any traces of zebra and quagga mussel veliger DNA throughout the California water system to prevent the negative effects associated with the spread of these introduced mussels."

    "text": "Sampling Protocols\nWhile this program includes many other regions and sampling methods, the map and sampling protocols listed here are specific to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. Sampling for this region takes place once a month at each of the three monitoring stations displayed on the map. At each station, a 45-meter horizontal surface tow is conducted using a 64-micron mesh plankton net. The material collected at the cod end of the net is that of which cannot pass through the 64-micron mesh. These particulates are rinsed into a sample container and submitted to a laboratory for PCR analysis, which determines presence/absence of zebra/quagga mussel veliger DNA. In order to sample all three stations in one day, some nets require decontamination in the field prior to reuse. This decontamination process consists of soaking each net in vinegar for a minimum of one hour and then spraying all surfaces of the net with a 10% bleach solution."

    "text": "Water quality is a measure of chemical and physical water conditions relative to the needs for aquatic and human life and is closely linked to the surrounding ecosystem and land use. Aquatic plants require suitable light, nutrients, and water temperatures to survive. Aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to breathe, and rely on adequate water temperature, salinity, and pH to survive. Humans need fresh water for recreation, irrigation, as well as to drink. Because of these competing needs, water quality is not easily defined as “good” or “bad,” since it depends on who is using it. However, water quality monitoring is a way for scientists to understand the health of our aquatic ecosystem and to help balance the needs of all who use it.\nTypically, water quality is defined by regulated standards set by a regulatory agency, like the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). If water quality does not meet the regulated standards, then it can be defined as poor. Water quality can be monitored continuously or in a discrete manner, both of which are done by the Environmental Monitoring Program. Discrete water quality monitoring is conducted less frequently than continuous and provides a snapshot into the water conditions at a single moment in time, which is helpful for documenting long-term trends. This type of sampling involves collecting a large quantity of water samples on a monthly basis to be analyzed for numerous water quality tests by a chemical laboratory. The Environmental Monitoring Program monitors 24 fixed discrete water quality stations within the San Francisco Estuary. These stations are sampled monthly at high water slack tide and are primarily accessed by the Research Vessel Sentinel, or by vehicle transport for shore-based stations. Sampling at each of these stations consists of collecting a variety of physical parameters (e.g. water temperature and pH) and grab samples for laboratory analysis (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Note: CEMP’s Sherman Island station (SSI), which was called D11A in previous reports, has been renamed D22A to better reflect it’s location in relation to historical station D22.\nData were collected for six water quality parameters. All water samples were collected 1-meter below the water surface using a float-mounted YSI EXO2 multi-parameter water quality sonde. These parameters are:\n\nWater Temperature (°C)\nSpecific Conductance (μS/cm)\nDissolved Oxygen (mg/L)\npH\nTurbidity (FNU)\nFluorescence (μg/L)\n\nRegional facet graphs for (report year text) were created for each parameter.

With assistance from the California Department of Water Resources (CDFW), each month EMP scientists visit up to 28 (24 fixed and 4 floating) stations to sample water quality and biological communities (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates). EMP also services and maintains a network of 15 continuous water quality stations that provide data in real time through the California Data Exchange Network. Since 1975, these efforts have established an irreplaceable ecological record in the San Francisco estuary that has been used in dozens of peer-review scientific articles and technical reports.\nAs a public endeavor, EMP embraces the principles of Open Science and makes the data it collects openly and freely available. This website provides yearly status-and-trends reports on water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates while also providing links to Environmental Data Initiative portals where quality-checked versions of EMP’s various datasets are available for download."

    "text": "The Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) is a joint effort by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) to characterize the aquatic environment of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Suisun, and San Pablo Bays. With assistance from the California Department of Water Resources (CDFW), each month EMP scientists visit up to 28 (24 fixed and 4 floating) stations to sample water quality and biological communities (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates).

    "text": "Program History\nEMP was formed in response to water quality objectives set by California’s State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Suisun, and San Pablo Bays. The data collected and analyzed by EMP scientists is essential for the effective management of water resources in the estuary and assures that the objectives mandated by SWRCB in the permits issued to DWR and UBSR are met. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels in the Delta. The regulatory basis for what became EMP began in 1971 when the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary in Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This decision provided the terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to evaluate changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. A monitoring program was first implemented in 1971 following the design laid out by the Stanford Research Institute (SWRCB Publication 40). These water quality standards were amended in 1978 (D-1485) and again in 1999 (D-1641). The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the requirements of the latter. The annual reports displayed on this website constitute the annual reports submitted to SWRCB by DWR and USBR in fulfillment of the D-1641 reporting requirement."
