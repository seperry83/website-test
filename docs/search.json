Sampling for this region takes place once a month at each of the three monitoring stations displayed on the map. At each station, a 45-meter horizontal surface tow is conducted using a 64-micron mesh plankton net. The material collected at the cod end of the net is that of which cannot pass through the 64-micron mesh. These particulates are rinsed into a sample container and submitted to a laboratory for PCR analysis, which determines presence/absence of zebra/quagga mussel veliger DNA. In order to sample all three stations in one day, some nets require decontamination in the field prior to reuse. This decontamination process consists of soaking each net in vinegar for a minimum of one hour and then spraying all surfaces of the net with a 10% bleach solution."

    "text": "Why are phytoplankton important?\nPhytoplankton are the foundation of the aquatic food web. They feed a diverse array of organisms, ranging from microscopic zooplankton to large pelagic fish. Small fish and benthic organisms also graze on phytoplankton, and are in turn consumed by larger organisms such as birds. Because of their importance as the base of the food web, changes in phytoplankton in the San Francisco Estuary can have cascading effects throughout the food web. For example, loss of phytoplankton species that are important food sources can negatively affect the zooplankton and fish species that feed on those phytoplankton, and thus negatively affect the animals preying on those zooplankton and fish.\nPhytoplankton can also affect elements of water quality such as pH, dissolved oxygen, taste and odor of drinking water, and water transparency. Large algal blooms, both toxic and non-toxic, can have adverse effects on the water quality parameters listed above. They can also have negative aesthetic effects by forming large, floating surface scums. Monitoring changes in phytoplankton can be useful in assessing water quality trends by detecting the presence of nuisance species or the development of large blooms that could require management action.\nChlorophyll-a is the primary photosynthetic product made by phytoplankton and plants, and gives them their green color. Chlorophyll-a is also a measure of the biomass that is directly available to organisms that prey on phytoplankton, such as clams and zooplankton.\nSometimes the green color is masked by secondary pigments, and these phytoplankton often appear brown or red instead of green. Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting chloro¬phyll-a concentrations in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. Well-established benthic populations of P. amurensis in Suisun and San Pablo bays are thought to have contrib¬uted to the low chlorophyll-a concentrations (and increased water clarity) measured in these westerly bays since the mid-1980s. By removing phytoplankton from the water, P. amurensis has reduced the amount of phytoplankton available to other organisms such as zooplankton."

    "text": "How is phytoplankton monitored?\nThe California DWR Phytoplankton and Chlorophyll-a monitoring measures the composition (what kinds?), abundance (how many?), diversity (how many kinds?), and distribution (where are they?) of phytoplankton. It also measures phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll-a; both types of monitoring are performed as part of the IEP’s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP). Thirteen fixed sites are currently sampled for both phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a, with two additional sites sampled at variable locations based on bottom specific conductance of 2,000 and 6,000 micro-Siemens, respectively. Historically, samples were collected once or twice monthly at up to 33 sites. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a samples are collected monthly alongside the water quality and zooplankton sampling. Whole, unfiltered water samples are collected monthly from one meter below the surface to determine phytoplankton composition; Lugol’s solution is then added as a stain and preservative. For chlorophyll-a samples, water is filtered onto glass carbon fiber filters for analysis. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a data are available from 1975 to the present.\nChanges in phytoplankton composition, abundance, diversity, distribution, and biomass are monitored throughout the San Francisco Estuary, from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne, and San Joaquin Rivers.\nBecause different phytoplankton species live in different parts of the Estuary, the sites represent a wide range of habitats of varying physical conditions, including wide ranges of salinity and temperature. Sites range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays."

    "text": "Water quality is a measure of chemical and physical water conditions relative to the needs for aquatic and human life and is closely linked to the surrounding ecosystem and land use. Aquatic plants require suitable light, nutrients, and water temperatures to survive. Aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to breathe, and rely on adequate water temperature, salinity, and pH to survive. Humans need fresh water for recreation, irrigation, as well as to drink. Because of these competing needs, water quality is not easily defined as “good” or “bad,” since it depends on who is using it. However, water quality monitoring is a way for scientists to understand the health of our aquatic ecosystem and to help balance the needs of all who use it.\nTypically, water quality is defined by regulated standards set by a regulatory agency, like the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). If water quality does not meet the regulated standards, then it can be defined as poor. Water quality can be monitored continuously or in a discrete manner, both of which are done by the Environmental Monitoring Program. Discrete water quality monitoring is conducted less frequently than continuous and provides a snapshot into the water conditions at a single moment in time, which is helpful for documenting long-term trends. This type of sampling involves collecting a large quantity of water samples on a monthly basis to be analyzed for numerous water quality tests by a chemical laboratory. The Environmental Monitoring Program monitors 24 fixed discrete water quality stations within the San Francisco Estuary. These stations are sampled monthly at high water slack tide and are primarily accessed by the Research Vessel Sentinel, or by vehicle transport for shore-based stations. Sampling at each of these stations consists of collecting a variety of physical parameters (e.g. water temperature and pH) and grab samples for laboratory analysis (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous)."

    "text": "Benthic organisms are creatures that live at the bottom of water bodies. This includes invertebrates (animals without backbones) like clams, shrimp, crabs, worms, aquatic insects, and small crustaceans called amphipods. Some benthic organisms live in or on the soft mud of the San Francisco Estuary, while others attach themselves to rocks and other hard surfaces. There are also benthic vertebrates (animals with backbones) that include various fish species.\nBenthic organisms are a central part of the estuarine food web, consuming and consumed by other creatures. Every winter during low-tides, thousands of migrating shorebirds feast upon uncovered clams, crabs, and worms found in the mudflats. Humans can also take advantage of the low tides to harvest these organisms. Certain fish species, including juvenile salmon, striped bass, and sturgeon, also consume many types of benthic organisms.\nA large percentage of the benthic organisms found in the San Francisco Estuary are non-native, and some of these species can have negative effects on the health of the estuary. For example, non-native clams can filter out much of the available phytoplankton, outcompeting the zooplankton who in turn are major sources of fish food. Historically, shrimp supported a large commercial fishery in San Francisco Estuary, and California’s commercial Dungeness crab fishery still depends upon crabs that spend the first two years of their life growing in the San Francisco Estuary.\nChanges in benthic organisms’ populations can be indications of larger changes in the physical conditions and water quality of the San Francisco Estuary, including alterations in pollution levels, freshwater inflows, salinity, and sediment composition."

Of the 185 benthic species collected in WY 2023, the ten most abundant species represented 80% of all individuals collected throughout the year (Figure 2). These include three species of amphipod, two clams, three oligochate worms, one polychate worm, and one cumacean arthropod (also known as a comma shrimp, although it is not actually a shrimp). Only three species in this group (the amphipods Americorophium spinicorne and Hyalella sp., and the oligochaete worm Ilyodrilus franzti) are native to this estuary. The rest of the top ten species are non-native or are cosmopolitan species of unknown origin. Refer to Fields and Messer (1999) for descriptions of the habitat requirements, physical attributes, and feeding methods of many of these species.\nIn the site descriptions that follow, most species densities are reported as the annual densities of individuals/m2, sometimes noting dramatic seasonal peaks. Some species, especially arthropods, display strong seasonal variability with peak monthly densities several times higher than their annual densities. In these cases, we reported the time and magnitude of the peaks as well as the annual densities. Please note that the station P8 was not sampled in December 2022 due to heavy fog, and comparisons to other years’ average annual densities or seasonal patterns should take this omission into account.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: List of ten most numerous benthic invertebrate species found at EMP sites."

Site D16 is on the lower San Joaquin River near Twitchell Island (Figure 1). There were 15 species in four phyla at D16 in WY 2023, split between Mollusca (62% of all organisms collected in 2023) and Arthropoda (37%) (Figure 3). The most abundant species at D16 was the clam Corbicula fluminea which accounted for 58% of all organisms in 2022, with an average annual density of 146 individuals/m2 and peaks in May and August 2023. The amphipod Gammarus daiberi was the second most abundant organism, accounting for 25% of all individuals, with an average annual density of 62 individuals/m2 and a peak in October 2022 of 230 individuals/m2 and another in February of 169 individuals/m2.  Much of the rest of the community was a combination of various species of amphipods and snails at lower densities. The total number of organisms at D16 in WY 2023 continued the trend of very low numbers compared with other years in the previous decade. In particular, WY 2020-2023 saw very low numbers of the amphipod Americorophium spinicorne, which was seen in very high numbers at D16 from 2015-2018.\nThe site on Old River near Rancho Del Rio is known as D28A (Figure 1). In WY 2023, there were 58 species in seven phyla at D28A. The most abundant phylum was Annelida, followed by Arthropoda and Mollusca (55%, 33%, and 12% of all organisms, respectively) (Figure 4). The most abundant species was the oligochaete worm Variachaetadrilus angustipenis with an average density of 1,494 individuals/m2 and high densities between December 2022 and May 2023, followed by the ostracod crustacean Cyprideis sp. A with an average density of 767 individuals/m2 and higher densities between December 2022 and March 2023.  The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea had an annual average density of 356 individuals/m2 that grew from April through July, likely via seasonal recruitment.  While D28A had similarly high species richness in WY 2023 to other years, a few notable differences were fewer of the amphipods Gammarus daiberi and Americorophium spinicorne, which were both more numerous in 2013, 2014, and 2022 than now, as well as many fewer of the sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa, which was the most numerous organism at D28A in several years of the past decade but in WY 2023 comprised just 3.5% of all organisms found here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D28A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfluence (D4)\nSite D4 is located near the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, just north of Point Sacramento (Figure 1). There were 41 species in six phyla at D4, and in WY 2023 this was the site with the highest number of organisms. Arthropoda was by far the most abundant phylum (88% of all organisms) followed by Annelida (7% of all organisms) and Mollusca (6% of all organisms) (Figure 5). The native amphipod Americorophium spinicorne was the most abundant species at this station and made up slightly over 71% of all individual organisms in WY 2023 with a dramatic seasonal peak of 55,279 individuals/m2 in August 2023 and an annual average of 8,436 individuals/m2, the highest annual average in a decade. The non-native amphipod Gammarus daiberi had an annual average of 1,562 individuals/m2, which was at low density before increasing  in June to a seasonal peak in September of 5,380 individuals/m2.  The invasive clam Corbicula fluminea also saw a summer seasonal increase, with a high in August of 1,788 and an annual average of 471 individuals/m2.\nBecause of D4’s position at the front of saltwater and freshwater mixing in the estuary, we often see a shift from the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea to more brackish-water Potamocorbula amurensis following dry years, and the reverse following wet years.  The drought of 2018-2022 led to high Potamocorbula numbers, which abruptly crashed down in WY 2023 while Corbicula increased modestly. 2022 was also notable for its rebound of amphipod A. spinicorne in 2022 from the low of WY 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Pablo Bay (D41, D41A)\nThe benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in San Pablo Bay, D41 and D41A. Station D41 is near Point Pinole (Figure 1) and has a benthic community primarily comprised of marine organisms, especially in drier water years. There were 76 species in seven phyla at D41 in WY 2023. Annelida was the most abundant phylum (37% of all organisms) followed by Phoronida (25%), Arthropoda (24%) and Mollusca (10%) (Figure 6). The single most abundant species was the Phoronis harmeri, a native tube-dwelling filter-feeder from the small marine lophophorate phylum Phoronida, with an average annual density of 490 individuals/m2 and representing 25% of all organisms. The second most abundant species was non-native amphipod Ampelisa abdita, comprising 19% of all organisms with 370 organisms/m2, most of them in a very strong peak in September 2023. The window shell clam Theora lubrica, along with the tube-dwelling polychate worm Pseudopolydora kempi and the polychaete worm Scoletoma luti, were the other species found in notable densities. D41 overall community composition in 2021 was similar to the preceding decade apart from the high numbers of Potamocorbula amurensis from WY 2017-2019,  and the decrease in the amphipod Ampelisca abdita from its very high levels in WY 2018-2021.  This pattern reinforces that higher-salinity water years such as 2021 see increases in more marine species such as Apelisca abdita, Phoronis harmeri, and Theora lubrica but lower numbers of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which prefers more brackish water and is mostly seen at D41 following wetter water years.\nStation D41A is in San Pablo Bay near the mouth of the Petaluma River (Figure 1). There were 51 species in seven phyla at D41A in WY 2023. The most abundant phyla was Arthropoda (39% of all organisms), with Annelida second (31%) and Mollusca third (26%) (Figure 7). The two most numerous species were the small cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon hinumensis , which had an annual average of 557 individuals/m2 and a strong seasonal peak from January-May, and the arthropod Ampelisca abdita, which had an annual average of 338 individuals/m2, almost all of which occurred in August and September 2023. The window shell clam Theora lubrica and the invasive overbite clam Potamocorbula amurensis had seasonally opposed patterns; T. lubrica had its peak in December and was not seen again after January 2023, while P. amurensis did not appear until February and was densest in August, likely because of the opposing effects of the wet winter of WY 2023 on the more marine T. lubrica and the more brackish-water P. amurensis. The community in 2022 was lacking in several species which had been numerically dominant for the previous decade: the amphipods Ampelisca abdita and Monocorophim acherusicum, the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, and the small cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon hinumensis were at some of their lowest levels in the last decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Delta (P8, C9)\nThe benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in the South Delta. Site P8 is on the San Joaquin River at Buckley Cove (Figure 1). Sampling did not occur in December 2022 due to very foggy conditions.  Station P8 had a total of 54 species in five phyla in WY 2023. Annelida was by far the most abundant phyla at this station in 2023, accounting for 90% of all organisms collected (?@fig-p8). The dominant species driving most of the Annelida patterns was the non-native sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa, which had an annual density of 5,501 individuals/m2 and accounted by itself for 59% of all organisms. Manayunkia speciosa in 2023 increased slightly from its lower densities from 2017 through 2022, but not close to the high densities seen from 2012 to 2016, which peaked at 11,705 individuals/m2 in WY 2016. The oligochate worms Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Varichaetadrilus angustipenis were the next most common organisms at 1,271 and 537individuals/m2 annual density, followed by a long tail of many species represented at low densities. This community composition has remained largely unchanged through the last decade, apart from the dramatic changes in of M. speciosa.\nSite C9 is on Old River at the Clifton Court Forebay intake (Figure 1). There were 85 species in seven phyla at C9 in WY 2023. Annelida was the dominant phylum throughout the year, accounting for 79% of all organisms collected in WY 2023, followed by 15% Arthropoda. (Figure 8). An oligochaete worm, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, made up 28% of all organisms with an annual density of 1,804 individuals/m2, which is roughly a quarter of its decade high value in WY 2012 of 5,454 individuals/m2. The oligochaete worms Varichaetadrilus angustipenis and Ilyodrilus frantzi were the next most numeous, with average densities of 1,755 and 1,670 individuals/m2. Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Ilyodrilus frantzi had their highest densities from May through September 2023.  The freshwater amphipod Hyalella sp. A was also notable with an annual average of 737 individuals/m2 through WY 2023, with two peaks in November 2022 and June 2023. Similar to P8, C9 has a large number of low-density species, including the highest diversity of aquatic insect larvae at any site sampled (23 species in WY 2023, mostly chironomid midges). The community was dominated by oligochaetes and had the same overall composition as it has for many years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station C9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station P8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuisun & Grizzly Bays (D6, D7)\nThe benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in the Suisun Bay area, D6 and D7. Site D6 is in Suisun Bay near the I-680 bridge (Figure 1) and had 28 species in five phyla in WY 2023. Mollusca was the dominant phylum, accounting for 97% of all organisms collected (Figure 10). Most of the organisms collected were the invasive Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which had an annual density of 9,345 individuals/m2, in an increase from its decade-long low in WY 2017 but still below its WY 2020 high of 23,800 individuals/m2. Potamocorbula amurensis was most abundant in August 2023 with 55,548 individuals/m2, likely as a result of summer seasonal recruitment. The relatively few other organisms found at this site were predominately from phylum Arthropoda, either the brackish-water bay barnacle Amphibalanus improvisus, found mostly growing on P. amurensis shells, or the cumacean crustacean Nippoleucon hinumensis.\nSite D7 is in Grizzly Bay, near the entrance to Suisun Slough (Figure 1). There were 29 species in three phyla in WY 2023. Mollusca comprised 64% of the total organisms, Arthropoda 28%, and Annelida 8%. The non-native clam Potamocorbula amurensis and the cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon hinumensis were the two most abundant species, comprising 64% and 21% of the total community through the year, respectively (Figure 11). Nippoleucon hinumensis had an annual density of 673 organisms/m2, but saw a strong seasonal pattern: relatively high densities from October through December and relatively lower densities the rest of the year, including almost none from June through September. Potamocorbula amurensis had an annual average density of 2,085/organisms/m2 and a very strongly seasonal pattern as well – high numbers in October 20022 decreasing through winter and spring, then an abrupt increase in seasonal recruitment in August to 9,284 organisms/m2. While P. amurensis has been numerically dominant through the last decade, a major change in WY 2021 was the rise of N. hinumensis and a simultaneous crash of the amphipod Sinocorophium alienense, which had been the second-densest species at D7 for at least the last decade. Sinocorophium alienense crashed in WY 2021 to around 576 organisms/m2, was completely absent from D7 in WY 2022, and barely appeared in WY 2023 at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D7."

    "text": "Interpretations\nIn summary, WY 2023 saw the second lowest average organism density of any year of the past decade, second only to WY 2022. This trend was consistent across most sites, and was caused largely by the decrease in various amphipod species, especially Ampelisca abdita in San Pablo Bay and Sinocorophium alienense in Grizzly Bay, as well as the decrease in the sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa at Central Delta sites. Since many fish species have switched to amphipod food sources after the collapse of mysid shrimps (Feyrer et al. 2003), the near disappearance of various amphipod species may have food web implications unless they have simply shifted their ranges out of our sampling area. Densities of the non-native clams Potamocorbula amurensis and Corbicula fluminea were also near decade lows in WY 2023, possibly because of the wet water year 2023, which caused clams to shift ranges downstream and their numbers to be depressed until they could recruit in the following warm season to their new salinity ranges.  Ordinarily, the decrease of both species of invasive clams and their filter-feeding activity would be a favorable sign for the ecosystem, but the relative absence of several other numerically dominant members of the community in WY 2023 has unclear implications. Our ability to recognize these changes over decadal timescales highlights the importance of continued monitoring of benthic invertebrates to a high taxonomic resolution across the entire estuarine salinity gradient, as the community interacts with both various abiotic conditions as well as key parts of the estuarine food web."

    "text": "Interpretations\nWater Year 2023 began as a continuation of the preceding three years of drought conditions, but a deluge of atmospheric rivers beginning in late December and continuing through March brought high amounts of precipitation and a massive snowpack, which resulted in WY 2023 ultimately being classified as Wet.\nThe extreme precipitation events and snowpack runoff led to a considerable drop in specific conductivity in the Delta. The low values persisted through WY 2023 in the Interior Delta regions, with the western regions of Grizzly/Suisun and the Confluence beginning to show a marine influence in July. Cooler than average air temperatures at the start of the water year and runoff from the record snowpack resulted in much cooler water average temperatures. The Water Year 2023 average was 2.1 ºC cooler than the critically dry Water Year 2022. High flows created by the winter storms resulted in high turbidity in January with maximum values in all regions exceeding 100 FNU. A smaller spike in turbidity occurred in March also due to storm runoff."

    "text": "Interpretations\nWater year 2023 in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys was classified as wet after three years of drought. Many atmospheric river storms brought considerable amounts of rain starting in late December and colder average temperatures contributed to record snowpack.\nSpecific conductance had a notable drop in all regions in January due to the influx of freshwater. Most regions continued to have low values throughout the rest of the water year due to snowpack runoff. The San Pablo, Suisun, and Grizzly Bay regions typically have higher values due to the strong marine influence from the Pacific Ocean, and they started to increase again in July. The average specific conductance in water year 2023 was much lower than the previous year. Turbidity had a notable spike in all regions in January due to sediment re-suspension caused by the high flows after a long dry period. Every region (except the Central Delta) had maximum values above 100 FNU. The average turbidity in water year 2023 was higher than the previous year.\nDissolved ammonia, dissolved nitrate + nitrite, and total phosphorus had a notable spike in all regions in January due to increased runoff of organic matter and pollutants. The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest values of all three nutrients likely due to nearby agricultural land use. The average of each nutrient in water year 2023 was similar to the previous year.\nChlorophyll a followed seasonal trends in most regions with higher values in the warmer summer months. The San Pablo Bay region had a small harmful algal bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo in July. C10A in the Southern Interior Delta had a spike in August, which is typically shallow during dry periods of the year. The average chlorophyll a in water year 2023 was a little higher than the previous year. More information about the phytoplankton genera is described in the phytoplankton section."

    "text": "Program History\nEMP was formed in response to water quality objectives set by California’s State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Suisun, and San Pablo Bays. The data collected and analyzed by EMP scientists is essential for the effective management of water resources in the estuary and assures that the objectives mandated by SWRCB in the permits issued to DWR and UBSR are met. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels in the Delta. The regulatory basis for what became EMP began in 1971 when the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary in Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This decision provided the terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to evaluate changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. A monitoring program was first implemented in 1971 following the design laid out by the Stanford Research Institute (SWRCB Publication 40). These water quality standards were amended in 1978 (D-1485) and again in 1999 (D-1641). The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the requirements of the latter. The annual reports displayed on this website constitute the annual reports submitted to SWRCB by DWR and USBR in fulfillment of the D-1641 reporting requirement."

    "text": "Interpretations\nOverall, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin-a, and phytoplankton abundance followed a seasonal pattern with the highest values of pigments and abundances in the spring and summer months and lower values and abundances in winter months. One exception was a large cyanobacterial bloom in January 2023 which occurred across all regions. However, this bloom was not associated with larger chlorophyll-a values, suggesting that, while the cyanobacteria were abundant, they were not producing large amounts of biomass as chlorophyll-a. Though cyanobacteria were dominant in the abundance counts, all phytoplankton fell into 12 distinct taxonomic groups distributed across all the regions of the San Francisco Estuary. Chlorophyll-a values were low throughout the year across all regions, with the majority of values below 10 µg/L, which is considered food limiting for zooplankton."

    "text": "Zooplankton in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) serve as a vital trophic link between aquatic primary producers and higher trophic level consumers. As primary consumers of phytoplankton, zooplankton facilitate the flow of carbon through a large and complex food web that historically supported abundant fisheries (Schroeter et al. 2015; Kimmerer et al. 2018). Zooplankton in the SFE are a key food source for endangered and threatened fish species, notably the Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) (Hobbs et al. 2006; Slater and Baxter 2014). Many species of fish, including Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) feed on zooplankton in the estuary as larvae and juveniles (Goertler et al. 2018; Heubach et al. 1963), while others like Tule Perch (Hysterocarpus traskii) and Prickly Sculpin (Cottus asper) include zooplankton in their diets throughout their lifetimes (Kimmerer 2006, Feyrer et al. 2003).\nThe importance of zooplankton in the estuarine food web prompted the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1972 to assess the prey resources available to fish in the upper SFE. Mandated by the State Water Resources Control Board’s Water Right Decision 1641, the study is conducted jointly by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department of Water Resources under the guidance and management of the Interagency Ecological Program. For over five decades this study has monitored the zooplankton community in the region, tracking abundance trends and distribution patterns, detecting and monitoring introduced species, and documenting dramatic shifts in community composition. Changes in zooplankton abundance and composition have been linked to major declines in pelagic fishes in the upper estuary (Sommer et al. 2007; Winder and Jassby 2011)."
