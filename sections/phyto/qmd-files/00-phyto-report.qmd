## Introduction

The Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) are required by Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) to collect phytoplankton and chlorophyll *a* samples to monitor algal community composition and biomass at select sites in the upper San Francisco Estuary (Estuary). This report describes the results of these monitoring efforts for water year `r report_year` (October 1st `r prev_year` through September 30th `r report_year`), `r str_water_year(report_year, 'cur')` [(source)](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=WSIHIST).

## Methods

Phytoplankton samples were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the Upper Estuary and were grouped into regions based on their geographic location (@fig-stations; @tbl-stations). These sites represent a variety of aquatic habitats, from narrow, freshwater channels to broad, estuarine bays.

```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
#| label: tbl-stations
#| tbl-cap: 'Stations included within each region of the Delta'

dwq_stations <- readr::read_csv(here::here('admin/figures-tables/dwq/dwq-stations.csv'))

styler$style_kable(dwq_stations)
```

### Phytoplankton

The 10 most common genera were determined by summing the normalized organism counts across all stations and months for each genus. For the bar graphs, average organism counts were calculated per month, per region, and normalized to the number of stations. Average summary statistics are reported as the mean (μ) ± the standard deviation.

For more in-depth methodology, see [here](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=edi.1320.6).

### Chlorophyll a and Pheophytin a

Samples of chlorophyll a and pheophytin a were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the upper Estuary using a submersible pump positioned 1 meter below the water's surface. Average analyte concentrations were then calculated per month, per region, and were normalized to the number of stations. Average summary statistics are reported as the median (M) ± the median absolute deviation.
