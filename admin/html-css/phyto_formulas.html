  Raw organism counts
were normalized to the sample volume using the following formula:
  <br><center>
  \(organisms/mL = {CA_{c} \over VA_{f}F}\)
  </center><br>
where \(C\) is the organism count, \(A_{c}\) is the area of the cell bottom (mm\(^2\)), \(A_{f}\)
is the area of each grid field (mm\(^2\)), \(F\) is the number of fields examined, and
\(V\) is the settled volume (mL). This simplifies to:
  <br><center>
  \(organisms/mL = {C \over cV}\)
  </center><br>
  where \(cV = {A_{c} \over VA_{f}F}\) and is equal to the counted volume.
